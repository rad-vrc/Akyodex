# Research Deep - Deep Research

## Trigger
When the user asks to start deep research after an outline has been generated.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Auto-locate Outline
Find `*/outline.yaml` file in current working directory, read items list, execution config (including items_per_agent).

### Step 2: Resume Check
- Check completed JSON files in output_dir
- Skip completed items

### Step 3: Batch Execution
- Batch by batch_size (need user approval before next batch)
- Each batch handles items_per_agent items
- Use web search for each item

**Parameter Retrieval**:
- `{topic}`: topic field from outline.yaml
- `{item_name}`: item's name field
- `{item_related_info}`: item's complete yaml content (name + category + description etc.)
- `{output_dir}`: execution.output_dir from outline.yaml (default: ./results)
- `{fields_path}`: absolute path to {topic}/fields.yaml
- `{output_path}`: absolute path to {output_dir}/{item_name_slug}.json (slugify item_name: replace spaces with _, remove special chars)

**Hard Constraint**: The following prompt must be strictly reproduced, only replacing variables in {xxx}, do not modify structure or wording.

**Research Template**:
```python
prompt = f"""## Task
Research {item_related_info}, output structured JSON to {output_path}

## Field Definitions
Read {fields_path} to get all field definitions

## Output Requirements
1. Output JSON according to fields defined in fields.yaml
2. Mark uncertain field values with [uncertain]
3. Add uncertain array at the end of JSON, listing all uncertain field names
4. All field values must be in English

## Output Path
{output_path}

## Validation
After completing JSON output, run validation script to ensure complete field coverage:
python .agent/skills/deep-research/research/validate_json.py -f {fields_path} -j {output_path}
Task is complete only after validation passes.
"""
```

### Step 4: Wait and Monitor
- Wait for current batch to complete
- Launch next batch
- Display progress

### Step 5: Summary Report
After all complete, output:
- Completion count
- Failed/uncertain marked items
- Output directory

## Web Search Reference
Refer to `.agent/skills/deep-research/agents/web-search-agent.md` for search methodology and modules in `.agent/skills/deep-research/agents/web-search-modules/`.
