# Research Skill - Preliminary Research

## Trigger
When the user asks to research a topic in depth, use this skill.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Generate Initial Framework from Model Knowledge
Based on topic, use model's existing knowledge to generate:
- Main research objects/items list in this domain
- Suggested research field framework

Output {step1_output}, ask the user to confirm:
- Need to add/remove items?
- Does field framework meet requirements?

### Step 2: Web Search Supplement
Ask the user for time range (e.g., last 6 months, since 2024, unlimited).

**Parameter Retrieval**:
- `{topic}`: User input research topic
- `{YYYY-MM-DD}`: Current date
- `{step1_output}`: Complete output from Step 1
- `{time_range}`: User specified time range

**Hard Constraint**: The following prompt must be strictly reproduced, only replacing variables in {xxx}, do not modify structure or wording.

Use web search to supplement the framework. **Prompt Template**:
```python
prompt = f"""## Task
Research topic: {topic}
Current date: {YYYY-MM-DD}

Based on the following initial framework, supplement latest items and recommended research fields.

## Existing Framework
{step1_output}

## Goals
1. Verify if existing items are missing important objects
2. Supplement items based on missing objects
3. Continue searching for {topic} related items within {time_range} and supplement
4. Supplement new fields

## Output Requirements
Return structured results directly (do not write files):

### Supplementary Items
- item_name: Brief explanation (why it should be added)
...

### Recommended Supplementary Fields
- field_name: Field description (why this dimension is needed)
...

### Sources
- [Source1](url1)
- [Source2](url2)
"""
```

### Step 3: Ask User for Existing Fields
Ask the user if they have an existing field definition file, if so read and merge.

### Step 4: Generate Outline (Separate Files)
Merge {step1_output}, {step2_output} and user's existing fields, generate two files:

**outline.yaml** (items + config):
- topic: Research topic
- items: Research objects list
- execution:
  - batch_size: Number of parallel agents (confirm with user)
  - items_per_agent: Items per agent (confirm with user)
  - output_dir: Results output directory (default: ./results)

**fields.yaml** (field definitions):
- Field categories and definitions
- Each field's name, description, detail_level
- detail_level hierarchy: brief -> moderate -> detailed
- uncertain: Uncertain fields list (reserved field, auto-filled in deep phase)

### Step 5: Output and Confirm
- Create directory: `./{topic_slug}/`
- Save: `outline.yaml` and `fields.yaml`
- Show to user for confirmation

## Output Path
```
{current_working_directory}/{topic_slug}/
  ├── outline.yaml    # items list + execution config
  └── fields.yaml     # field definitions
```

## Follow-up Skills
- `deep-research/research-add-items` - Supplement items
- `deep-research/research-add-fields` - Supplement fields
- `deep-research/research-deep` - Start deep research

## Web Search Agent Reference
When performing web searches, refer to `.agent/skills/deep-research/agents/web-search-agent.md` for search methodology and modules in `.agent/skills/deep-research/agents/web-search-modules/`.
